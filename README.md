# Simple_Web_Generating_Tool
A simple web generating tool to generate webs for books

This would combine a head and a tail and a text into a web.
Haven't add the code for the comments part yet so the links in the web will be unavailable, will add that part later.

Example:

The provided css files and js file are just for examples.

Using the code: `main("example_head.txt","example_result","example_tail.txt","example_text.txt",2)` to get the `example_result.html`
you will have a web of the first chapter of the book 1 of "MaoXuan"

Using the code: `main("example_head.txt","complex_example_result","example_tail.txt","complex_example_text.txt",2)` to get the `complex_example_result.html`
you will have a web of the last chapter of the book 1 of "MaoXuan"
